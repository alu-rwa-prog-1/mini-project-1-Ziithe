# Mini-Project1
Assignment Goals:
The objective of this assignment is for you to create beautiful apps faster with Flutterâ€™s collection of the visual, structural, platform, and interactive widgets.
Your task is to create an Android/IoS flutter UI App that lets you shop (do a purchase or make a sale). Your app should have at least the following:
- Title bar with the name of the app
- Flutter Widgets such as scrolling, navigation, icons, fonts, etc.
- Since this is a simple UI template, a single page is expected which shows a list of products, prices, and categories is an added value

# PROCESS
In this assignment, I was able to implement and use the following widgets and elements to create my app; Classes, ListViews, GridViews, Cards, Columns, Rows, Dividers, Avatars and many other OOP elements.

In addition to the content covered through to week 3, the following were some of the sources I used to achieve my ideal UI.

# NOTES:
- To run this app, make sure flutter run is being run from the Ziithe_MiniProject1_Wk3 Directory
- My application was run and tested on an Android 6.15-Inch Screen as well as on a pixel3 Android Emulator; renderflow errors may therefore occur on some smaller screens .

Below are some screenshots of the Application:
